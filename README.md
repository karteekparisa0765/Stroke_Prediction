# Stroke_Prediction
This project predicts stroke occurrences using machine learning on a healthcare dataset. It includes data preprocessing (label encoding, KNN imputation, SMOTE for balancing), and trains models like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression. The goal is to develop a robust model for stroke prediction.
